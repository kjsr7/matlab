This repository consists of Matlab source codes of various benchmark problems (sphere, Rastrigin, Ackley and other functions) optimized using various bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms like PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution and TLBO (Teacher Learning Based Optimization) and also hybrid among these algorithms. Apart from these, major work was the implementation of a new approach to path planning of a mobile robot using various PSO variants and comparison of their performances. Finally, a paper titled 'Performance Comparison of PSO Algorithms for
Mobile Robot Path Planning in Complex
Environments' has been presented at the RACEE 2017 International conference. The work was done under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Ravi Kumar Jatoth of ECE Department.
